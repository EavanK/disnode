> We all use one of chat applications every day. Before I started studying development, I wondered how chat apps are built. I could've found a piece of answers during Bootcamp. And since we (**[Adam](https://github.com/adamhirzalla), [Jonathan](https://github.com/hjonsu)**) had similar ideas that we wanted to create our own chat application, We decided to build **Disnode**.

## üìö Introduction

[**Disnode**](https://disnodejs.netlify.app/) is a full-stack application that allows users to create or join existing servers, connecting with others that share similar interests.

### ü§ù **Collaborators**:

Each member focused mainly on different parts for this project, while also familiarizing each other with the rest of the application for context and also we tried our best to be involved with all the stack.

- Hyunsu Kim ([**@EavanK**](https://github.com/EavanK)) - _Middleman for backend/frontend (wire-ups), Front-end (React States/components), User Authorization - JWT (server + client) & API_
- Adam Hirzalla ([**@adamhirzalla**](https://github.com/adamhirzalla)) - _Back-end (server and API routes), DB Architecture (ERD/Schema/Queries + shaping data), Sockets (server + client), AWS-S3 (server + client) & Front-end (React Contexts/Reducers + refactors)_
- Jonathan Su ([**@hjonsu**](https://github.com/hjonsu)) - _Front-end (styling/design), MUI components & Wireframes_

> This app was created as part of our final project for Lighthouse Labs - Web Development Bootcamp. The goal was to create a full-stack application from start to finish in just two weeks.
